###  Readme
Seenig something like this when you press any hotkey?|

[![Splash on screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arshit09/AutoHotKey-Script/main/assets/fullscreen-splash.gif "Splash on screen")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arshit09/AutoHotKey-Script/main/assets/fullscreen-splash.gif "Splash on screen")

Sometimes some program or any macro, for any possible reason, takes more than one second to execute, and I find myself doubting whether I pressed the correct hotkey combination or not. So, I have added the tiny splash that appears on the screen when any correct hotkey combination is pressed. Just remove `splash()` call if you do not want to see somethnig like that.
